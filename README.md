# nutz-test
## I want to show something to my friends and complete it with my friends.
### I do not use ssh or ssm because I need something slim.So I try to use _nutz_.
letâ€™s start it.
### nutz is a mvc framework that is used in java.It has many advantages.
1. thin. the jar is only 910kB.
2. complete. the abilities that ssh,sum have,nuts also has it.
3. on you own.the code is not too hard.you can change it on you own.

### I will also try to use react-js.
### now i want to use it in my project.

### Last friday
I use bootstrap to do a sign in and sign out.I do not complete it. So maybe I will choose another time to complete it.

### these days busy.
the Chinese new year is coming soon.these days I am busy about checking my work with other system,so I do not have time to do it.I will keep going on it.Trust me.
