# nutz-test
## I want to show something to my friends and complete it with my friends.
### I do not use ssh or ssm because I need something slim.So I try to use _nutz_.
letâ€™s start it.
### nutz is a mvc framework that is used in java.It has many advantages.
1. thin. the jar is only 910kB.
2. complete. the abilities that ssh,sum have,nuts also has it.
3. on you own.the code is not too hard.you can change it on you own.
### now i want to use it in my project.
good luck.
